Gender at Work: Analyzing Workplace Disparities
This repository contains assignments and projects from the Computational Social Science 1B course, Gender at Work. All projects were created using Hex and focus on analyzing gender disparities in the workplace, testing hypotheses about social structures, and exploring predictive modeling.

Key topics include:
1. The impact of social structures and family norms on gender-based earnings gaps : Please check out my [hex notebook] on this topic(https://app.hex.tech/beresford-berkeley/app/315e596f-34be-45ff-8e87-88718e92ae70/latest).
2. Predictive models for understanding gender disparities
